## üìå Introduction

Dive into the data jobs market! Focusing on data analyst roles, this project explores top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and where high demand meets high salary in data analytics.

---

## üìö Background

Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more efficiently, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paying and in-demand skills‚Äîstreamlining the job search process for others seeking optimal opportunities.

### The questions I aimed to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. Which companies offer the highest salaries for data analyst roles?
2. What skills are most commonly required by those companies?
3. What skills are in highest demand for data analyst positions overall?
4. Which skills are associated with the highest salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn for aspiring data analysts?

## üõ† Tools I Used

| Tool        | Purpose                            |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| SQL         | Data extraction, querying, and analysis |
| Power BI    | Data visualization and dashboards  |

## üìä The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of data analyst job market. 
Here's how I approach each question:

### **1. Top 10 Companies**
To identify the top companies offering the highest-paying remote data analyst positions, I filtered job postings by average yearly salary and selected only those marked as remote (`job_work_from_home = True`). The resulting query highlights the top 10 companies with the most competitive salaries for data analyst roles.

```sql
SELECT 
    d.name,
    f.job_schedule_type,
    f.job_posted_date::DATE,
    f.salary_year_avg AS totals
FROM 
    job_postings_fact AS f
INNER JOIN 
    company_dim AS d
USING (company_id)
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
ORDER BY 
    totals DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
---

### **2. Skills Required by Top Companies**

To identify the most commonly required skills by companies offering high-paying remote data analyst roles, I applied the same filtering method as in the previous query‚Äîfocusing on remote jobs with available salary data. This time, I expanded the query by joining additional tables to extract and aggregate the specific skills associated with those job postings.  

By joining the job postings with the corresponding skill data, the query reveals the top 10 most frequently requested skills among companies that offer competitive salaries for data analyst positions. This insight can help job seekers prioritize which skills to learn or improve based on actual market demand.

```sql
WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT 
        f.job_id,
        d.name,
        f.job_schedule_type,
        f.job_posted_date::DATE,
        f.salary_year_avg AS totals
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact AS f
    INNER JOIN 
        company_dim AS d
    USING (company_id)
    WHERE 
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
)
SELECT
    d2.skills,
    COUNT(f.job_id) AS total
FROM 
    skills_demand AS f
INNER JOIN 
    skills_job_dim AS d
USING (job_id)
INNER JOIN 
    skills_dim AS d2 
    ON d.skill_id = d2.skill_id
GROUP BY
    d2.skills
ORDER BY 
    total DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
