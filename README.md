## üìå Introduction

Dive into the data jobs market! Focusing on data analyst roles, this project explores top-paying jobs, in-demand skills, and where high demand meets high salary in data analytics.

---

## üìö Background

Driven by a quest to navigate the data analyst job market more efficiently, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paying and in-demand skills‚Äîstreamlining the job search process for others seeking optimal opportunities.

### The questions I aimed to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. Which companies offer the highest salaries for data analyst roles?
2. What skills are most commonly required by those companies?
3. What skills are in highest demand for data analyst positions overall?
4. Which skills are associated with the highest salaries?
5. What are the most optimal skills to learn for aspiring data analysts?

## üìä The Analysis
Each SQL query in this project was designed to explore specific aspects of the data analyst job market. The goal was to uncover insights that can help job seekers better understand which companies offer the best opportunities, which skills are most in demand, and which ones are associated with higher salaries‚Äîespecially for remote roles.

Here's how I approached each question:

### **1. Top 10 Companies**
To identify the top companies offering the highest-paying remote data analyst positions, I filtered job postings by average yearly salary and selected only those marked as remote (`job_work_from_home = True`). The resulting query highlights the top 10 companies with the most competitive salaries for data analyst roles.

```sql
SELECT 
    d.name,
    f.job_schedule_type,
    f.job_posted_date::DATE,
    f.salary_year_avg AS totals
FROM 
    job_postings_fact AS f
INNER JOIN 
    company_dim AS d
USING (company_id)
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
ORDER BY 
    totals DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
---

### **2. Skills Required by Top Companies**

To identify the most commonly required skills by companies offering high-paying remote data analyst roles, I applied the same filtering method as in the previous query‚Äîfocusing on remote jobs with available salary data. This time, I expanded the query by joining additional tables to extract and aggregate the specific skills associated with those job postings.  

By joining the job postings with the corresponding skill data, the query reveals the top 10 most frequently requested skills among companies that offer competitive salaries for data analyst positions. This insight can help job seekers prioritize which skills to learn or improve based on actual market demand.

```sql
WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT 
        f.job_id,
        d.name,
        f.job_schedule_type,
        f.job_posted_date::DATE,
        f.salary_year_avg AS totals
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact AS f
    INNER JOIN 
        company_dim AS d
    USING (company_id)
    WHERE 
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
        AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
)
SELECT
    d2.skills,
    COUNT(f.job_id) AS total
FROM 
    skills_demand AS f
INNER JOIN 
    skills_job_dim AS d
USING (job_id)
INNER JOIN 
    skills_dim AS d2 
    ON d.skill_id = d2.skill_id
GROUP BY
    d2.skills
ORDER BY 
    total DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
---

### **3. Most In-Demand Skills Across All Locations**

To determine which skills are most in demand for data analyst roles across all job locations‚Äînot just remote‚ÄîI broadened the scope of the filtering criteria. In this query, I selected all data analyst job postings regardless of location, allowing for a more comprehensive view of the skills that employers are consistently looking for in the market as a whole.

By joining job posting data with associated skill data, the query identifies the top 10 most frequently mentioned skills in job listings. The result highlights that **SQL, Excel, Python, Tableau, and Power BI** are among the most sought-after skills for data analysts across the industry.  

This insight is especially valuable for professionals who want to remain competitive in the broader job market, regardless of whether they prefer on-site, hybrid, or remote work settings.

```sql
WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT 
        f.job_id,
        d.name,
        f.job_schedule_type,
        f.job_posted_date::DATE,
        f.salary_year_avg AS totals
    FROM 
        job_postings_fact AS f
    INNER JOIN 
        company_dim AS d
    USING (company_id)
    WHERE 
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
)
SELECT
    d2.skills,
    COUNT(f.job_id) AS total
FROM 
    skills_demand AS f
JOIN 
    skills_job_dim AS d
USING (job_id)
INNER JOIN 
    skills_dim AS d2 
    ON d.skill_id = d2.skill_id
GROUP BY
    d2.skills
ORDER BY 
    total DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### **4. Top-Paying Skills for Remote Data Analyst Roles**

In this analysis, I focused on identifying the **top 25 highest-paying skills** associated with remote data analyst positions. By filtering the job postings dataset to include only roles titled *Data Analyst* that are fully remote (`job_work_from_home = TRUE`) and have a specified average annual salary, I was able to calculate the average salary linked to each individual skill.

The query joins job data with skill data to determine which skills are most valuable in terms of compensation. The results represent the top 25 skills that yield the highest average salaries, providing clear guidance for professionals aiming to maximize their earning potential in remote data analyst roles.

```sql
SELECT
    d2.skills,
    ROUND(
        AVG(f.salary_year_avg)::NUMERIC, 0
    ) AS salary_average
FROM
    job_postings_fact AS f
INNER JOIN 
    skills_job_dim AS d
USING (job_id)
INNER JOIN
    skills_dim AS d2 ON d.skill_id = d2.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY 
    d2.skills
ORDER BY
    salary_average DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

### **5. High-Demand and High-Paying Skills for Remote Data Analyst Roles**

This analysis aims to identify skills that are both **highly demanded** and **well-compensated** within remote data analyst job postings. By combining data on skill demand and average salary, we can pinpoint the most valuable skills for professionals seeking to optimize their career in the data analytics field‚Äîespecially in remote work settings.

To do this, I applied filters for:
- Job title: *Data Analyst*
- Remote positions only (`job_work_from_home = TRUE`)
- Postings with available average annual salary data

The query is structured in two parts:
1. **`skills_demand`**: Calculates how frequently each skill appears in remote data analyst postings, giving us a measure of demand.
2. **`salary_average`**: Computes the average salary associated with each skill from those same filtered postings.

These two subqueries are then joined to provide a combined view, showing the top 10 skills that strike the best balance between **market demand** and **earning potential**.

```sql
WITH skills_demand AS (
    SELECT
        d2.skill_id,
        d2.skills,
        COUNT(f.job_id) AS total
    FROM
        job_postings_fact AS f
    INNER JOIN 
        skills_job_dim AS d
    USING (job_id) 
    INNER JOIN 
        skills_dim AS d2 ON d.skill_id = d2.skill_id
    WHERE 
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        d2.skill_id, d2.skills
),
salary_average AS (
    SELECT
        d2.skill_id,
        d2.skills,
        ROUND(
            AVG(f.salary_year_avg)::NUMERIC, 0
        ) AS salary_average
    FROM
        job_postings_fact AS f
    INNER JOIN 
        skills_job_dim AS d
    USING (job_id)
    INNER JOIN
        skills_dim AS d2 ON d.skill_id = d2.skill_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_work_from_home = TRUE
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        d2.skill_id, d2.skills
)
SELECT
    f.skills,
    SUM(f.total) AS demand,
    ROUND(
        AVG(d.salary_average)::NUMERIC, 0
    ) AS salary 
FROM 
    skills_demand AS f
INNER JOIN 
    salary_average AS d
USING (skill_id)
GROUP BY 
    f.skills
ORDER BY
    demand DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
